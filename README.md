# Advanced Machin Learning Project: DQN and Policy Gradient Models for Pong
The notebook contains codes of the Policy Gradient Model for Pong game.
The notebook consists of four parts as below.
1. Construct Policy network and define functions for saving and reloading models during training
2. Set up logging directory
3. Set up parameters, which can be further experimented with
4. Training the Policy network and save training results and videos

In order to reproduce similar result, you just need to run all the kernels sequentially. 

The trained agent receives an average reward of 6 after 2 days of training on a Maxbook Pro until 20,000 episodes.
Below is an example of an episode played by our trained agent attaining a score of 6.
